    <h2 style="text-align:left;">What Are IoT Applications?</h2>

    <p class="p1">
      IoT applications run on IoT devices and can be created to be specific to almost every industry
      and vertical, including healthcare, industrial automation, smart homes and buildings, automotive,
      and wearable technology. Increasingly, IoT applications are using AI and machine learning to add intelligence 
      to devices. The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, 
      and other items that are connected to the internet and can communicate with each other. IoT applications 
      refer to the various ways in which these connected devices can be used to enhance efficiency, 
      productivity, and convenience in various industries and everyday life.
    </p>

    <h2 style="text-align:left;">Examples of IoT applications</h2>
    <h3>Smart homes:</h3>
    <p> IoT-enabled devices such as thermostats, lighting systems, security cameras, and appliances can be connected to a central hub and controlled remotely via a smartphone or voice assistant.</p>

    <h3>Agriculture:</h3>
    <p>IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels, crop growth, and weather conditions, allowing farmers to make data-driven decisions about irrigation and fertilization.</p>

      In the first activity we got to know about what an IoT application is and for purpose it
      is used. After some discussion with the team we came to a conclusion that it displays
      the data collected from devices and sensors and statistically organise it. Some of the
      main features of an IoT application are connectivity, analyzing, itnegration, user
      friendly interface. we also looked at some of the IoT application that we use on a daily
      basis. For example, Smart watches, home security, traffic managment, etcetra.

      In the second activity we discussed about a smart building and thought of various smart
      things that can be used in the building to make it more smart. After the discussion we
      came up with a defination of a smart building, it is a building which uses certain
      resources efficiently, so that the living enviroment of the residents enhances and remains
      safe. It should include automaiton of tasks. Some of the smart building scenarios could
      be Automated air conditioning and heating system, motion controlled lights in specified halls.

      In the third activity we talked about the control interface of an IoT application also
      discussed about its features and who are the users of the application. We thought of a
      smart parking system with empty slot notification. Its users can be the Staff entering
      the building with their personal vehical, residents of the building, guests, emergency
      service officials. For the components that can be used in this system could be weight
      sensor/pressure plates, amplifier, online database, QR code generator.
